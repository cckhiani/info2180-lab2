            <p>Was it my lifelong dream to be a software developer? Let's see, when I was five I wanted to be a doctor. At nine, I was certain I would become a lawyer. Once again, at fourteen I was choosing CSEC science subjects in preparation to get into med school so I could be a doctor. The Indian genes almost won, well, I mean they kinda won regardless. So, when the time actually came for me to choose what I want to study in university, why did I pick Computer Science? If I'm being honest, at eighteen years old, I wasn't completely sure what I wanted to commit to doing for the rest of my life. This was an extremely important decision that would shape the trajectory of my entire life and it was all in MY HANDS?! This was incredibly intimidating, to say the least. I therefore did what any sensible person would do; I googled "highest paying careers" and saw Software Development at the top of the list.</p>

            <p>BINGO! That's how eighteen year old me decided to study Computer Science. Let's just say my decision making skills have improved a bit since then. Am I mad at that decison, though? That answer has changed over the course of my time studying for this degree. In first year, I was having a really hard time keeping up and staying interested. I had no prior experience with any coding languages and felt a high sense of imposter syndrome. I even considered dropping out. However, fast forward to like two years later and I'm glad I stuck it out. With determination, consistency and practice, everything became a bit easier and began to feel more natural. I found an appreciation for what I'm learning and I can truly see myself applying this knowledge in a career that will fulfill me for my entire life. I've developed a significant interest in Web Development and I'm even considering specializing in it. I think it's safe to say that I made the right decision. Thanks Google!</p>

            <p>When I'm not busy being an academic weapon, there's a few things I enjoy doing. Let's talk about these things. Well, I type and you read. For one, I obviously love spending time with my girlfriends. I love spending time with my family as well. Even though I live on hall I make it a point to pack up my car with my kurroaches and go home every weekend. Maybe I have attachment issues. Anyways! I try to live a healthy lifestyle therefore I take pride in the fact that I'm in the gym atleast four times a week. Still working on the food part so if you see me in KFC mind your business.</p>

            <p>While we're on the KFC note, I might as well mention that I really enjoy cooking. It's kind of therapeutic for me plus the food is like a reward at the end. Another thing that I like to spend my time doing is practicing services offered in the beauty industry such as eyelashes and eybrows. I've recently taken a course related to this and I'm working towards this being another career path for me as well. Dad always said never to rely on one stream of income. Oh, almost forgot! My last and favourite thing to do outside of school is lay down and watch TikToks.</p>
